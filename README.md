# IT-Support-Ticket-Classifier-
Automating Ticket Categorization with ML Ever wondered how big companies manage hundreds or thousands of IT support tickets? This project shows how we can use Machine Learning to automatically classify support tickets into categories like software issues, hardware problems, and network errors ‚Äî saving tons of time and effort!

# Technologies Used
Python 

Pandas & Numpy for data handling

Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualizations

Scikit-learn for machine learning

TfidfVectorizer for text processing

Logistic Regression for classification

 # How It Works (Behind the Scenes)
 
Data Preprocessing ‚Äì We clean the text (remove punctuation, lowercase everything, etc.)

Text Vectorization ‚Äì We convert ticket text into numerical features using TF-IDF.

Model Training ‚Äì We train a Logistic Regression model on labeled data.

Evaluation ‚Äì We test how well the model performs using accuracy and classification metrics.

Prediction ‚Äì Feed in new ticket descriptions and get the issue category instantly!

# Future Improvements

Integrate this with a chatbot or web app (e.g., using Streamlit)

Add more ticket categories

Try deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for even better accuracy
